<h1>My dear Z,</h1>
<p>
  I have to say it took me many hours... actually days, to figure out how I wanted to start this letter. 
  It wasn't because I didn't know what to say but because I have so much. 
  And I thought, "why not say that!?", but then recoiled slightly at how cliche it all is. Anyway, this me, 
  finally relenting with the acute awareness that this is a long overdue reply to your letter back in March! 
  Hopefully, the medium with which this letter is sent makes it worth the wait! :) 
</p>

<p>
  I have had this idea for some time now, but I admittedly haven't had the technical skill to pull it off. The tech-savvy would 
  scoff at the suggestion that this was an even remotely complex task. 
  As an honorary member of the "30+ community" however, this is very much on par with landing a man on the 
  moon! Nevertheless, here it is, the product of many confusing lessons on the internet and with my brother.
   It's my first entry into "the Diary" I told you about, and I thought what better way to test my foray into the 
   world of coding and computer programs than to write a love letter to you and host it on the internet!
</p>

<p>
  I have come to enjoy writing to you for many reasons. Upon reflection, I realise that it is mainly
   because I feel a part of some distant world where only the two of us exist. Somewhere only we could visit,
    uniquely ours. I really like that idea, and I certainly felt it when reading your letter. It was a
     beautiful letter, and it made me realise that my prediction that we would get better at this over time
      is indeed accurate (you seem to be progressing much faster than I am!). You mentioned how at ease and 
      unafraid you feel in our relationship, so do I, my dear. I feel a sense of calm about us that I haven’t
       felt in a long time. I have fallen deeply and utterly in love with you, and I would have it no other way. 
</p>

<P>
  It was such a joy seeing you in London. After all this time, I kept wondering why I didn’t see you 
  sooner and more often. I feel at home with you, and I hope that you do with me too. I look back at 
  my time on the farm last week and at how I looked forward to sharing all the adventures of the day 
  with you. It was by far the best part of the whole experience, as exciting as it was. All this to say
   that I think of you too, my love, with an effortless constancy. With every sunset, I discover more 
   reasons to adore, appreciate, cherish and love you. And every time I would think it impossible to feel more towards 
   you, you would prove me wrong. 
</P>
<p>
  Salma has joined our tiny but growing clan. I know you must think it's cute that I think I am a part of it,
   seeing as I barely got a first chance to name the last addition! In case you were wondering, this is why 
   I was desperately trying to remember ‘her’ name. I really dropped the ball on that one. There's an 
   imbalance in our naming powers that doesn't quite sit right with me and this incident certainly doesn’t 
   help my case. I hope that Salma’s inclusion in this letter shows you how much she means to me and that my 
   partial powers are duly reinstated. But I must say, it brings me immense joy seeing that beatific smile 
   every time you come back from the shops with a plant and how resolutely you decide matters to do with
    their name. It’s just one of the many things you do that lights my heart up, Z.
</p>

<p>
  Before I sign off, I want you to know how much it meant to me when you told me who you would include in 
  prayers this Ramadan. I can’t think of anything that would mean more to me. She would’ve loved you, Z, and
   it means the world to me that she has come to mean a lot to you too. This month has given me a chance to 
   reflect and consider so much more than I ever have. The time we spend in each other’s company over the 
   phone and your soothing presence (albeit virtual) amidst the tumult of the past few weeks is something 
   that makes me look forward to the future I hope to build with you. I only pray that we grow stronger in 
   our bond and be a source of strength for each other.

<p>PS: You mentioned how much you liked the jumper when I visited. It’s a bit tired, but it’s yours now. 
  I hope you like it! :)</p>
