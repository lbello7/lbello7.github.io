<h1>Z...</h1>
<p>
  I have to say it took me many hours... actually days, to figure out how I wanted to start this letter. 
  It wasn't because I didn't know what to say but because I have so much. And then I thought, "why not say that!?", but then recoiled slightly at how 
  cliche it is. Anyway, this me, finally relenting with the acute awarenes that this is a long overdue reply to your wonderful letter all the way back in march.
  Hopefully, the medium with which this one is sent makes it worth the wait:). I have had this idea for sometime now but I admittedly
   haven't had the technical skill to pull it off. More technically minded people would scoff at the insinuation that this was an even remotely complex task, but as an honourary member of the "30+ community", this is very much on par with landing a man on the moon!
   Nevertheless, here it is, the product of a lot confusing lessons on the internet and with my brother. It's my first entry into "the Diary" I told you about (if you can remember), and I thought what better way to test foray into the 
   world of coding and computer programs, than to write a love letter to you and host it on the internet! 
</p>

<p>
  So much has happened since your letter.... Mystuff, work (the pavilion), applications and Ssmthng(the plant) has joined our little but growing clan. 
   I know you must think it's cute that I think I am a part of it, seeing as I barely got a first chance to name the last addition! There's an inherent asymetry in our naming powers that doesn't quite sit right with me.
   But I must confess that deep down, a part of me accepts it and actually welcome it because you are undeniabely more gifted with the creativity in that department. It's joyful the look on your face everytime you come back from the shops with 
   a plant and the seriously resolute manner in which you decide matters to do with their name. Its just one of the many things you do that lights my heart up Z. 
   Everyday I discover new reasons to love you even more than I do. And just when I would ......

  Currently in Ramadan, how I felt when she called me that night and what she told me she would pray for. 
Want her to know how much that meant to me.
